## Godot 3 Workshop

During the 2018 JAC at the [University of Santa Cruz do Sul](https://unisc.br), a workshop was done to teach new developers how to get started developing games with [Godot 3](https://godotengine.org).
This repository holds the start version, which mainly contains the assets for the game, and the end version, which is the final game.

Assets are all from [Kenney](https://kenney.nl).
